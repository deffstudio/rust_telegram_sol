# Telegram Solana Crypto Trading Bot

This project is a prototype for a Telegram bot that allows users to interact with the Solana blockchain and perform basic trading operations.

## Features

* **Connect to Local Solana Validator**: The bot can connect to your local Solana validator for testing and development purposes.
* **Check SOL Balance**: Users can query their SOL balance using the `/balance` command.
* **Telegram Integration**: The bot interacts with users through Telegram commands and messages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Rust and Cargo**: Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. You can follow the instructions at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
* **Solana CLI**: Install the Solana CLI to generate and manage your keypair. Follow the instructions at [https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).
* **Local Solana Validator**: Set up and run a local Solana validator for testing. You can use the `solana-test-validator` command.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/deffstudio/rust_telegram_sol.git](https://github.com/deffstudio/rust_telegram_sol.git) 
   cd telegram-solana-trader

2. **Set Up Your Environment**:

     Create a .env file:

      In the root directory of your project, create a file named .env.

      Open the .env file and add the following line, replacing <YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN> with the actual token you obtained from BotFather:

       ```bash
       TELOXIDE_TOKEN=<YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN>
       Generate a Solana Keypair:

      Open your terminal and use the Solana CLI to generate a new keypair:

       ```bash
       solana-keygen new --outfile path/to/your/keypair.json
       Use code with caution.
       ```

      This command will create a new keypair and save it to the specified file (keypair.json). Make sure to store this file securely, as it contains your private key, which is essential for interacting with the Solana blockchain.

3. **Build and Run the Bot**

   Navigate to your project's root directory in your terminal.
   
   Execute the following command, providing the path to your Solana keypair file:
   
      ```bash
      cargo run -- --keypair_path path/to/your/keypair.json
      Use code with caution.
      ```
      
   Replace path/to/your/keypair.json with the actual path to the keypair file you generated in the previous step.

***Usage***
   Open Telegram and start a conversation with your bot. You can find your bot by searching for its username.
   
   Use the /help command to see a list of available commands and their descriptions.
   
   Use the /balance command to check your SOL balance on the local validator.
